  feature: Walk your Bike
  description: |
    A permissive sign that indicates you may walk your bike.
    This sign alone does not make dismounting mandatory.
    Tagging them will be useful for indicating areas where
    there is insufficient space to share with pedestrians or
    where legal road crossing facilities have not been provided.
