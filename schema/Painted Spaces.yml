features:
- feature: Buffered bike lane
  description: |
    Not to be confused with a protected bike lane (described in the previous section). The bike lane and roadway share a continuous surface but are separated by flimsy treatments that may include:
    - flex stakes
    - double paint line
  elements:
    - way
  osm:
    - cycleway=lane
    - cycleway:buffer=yes
    - cycleway:buffer=0.5

- feature: Painted bike lane, on a divided road
  description: |
    A single line of paint delineates the bike lane.
    Bike symbol may be painted in the lane.

    The lane is reserved for bikes by posted signage.
  elements:
    - way
  osm:
    - cycleway:right=lane

- feature: Painted bike lane, on an undivided road
  description: |
    A single line of paint delineates the bike lane.
    Bike symbol may be painted in the lane.

    The lane is reserved for bikes by posted signage.

- feature: Advisory bike lane
  description: |
    Dashed lines delineate bike lanes on each side of the street, and this functions like any other bike lane for cyclists. The remaining roadway is too narrow for two-way motor traffic.
    Motorists may enter the bike lanes when encountering an oncoming vehicle, but must give priority to cyclists.
  elements:
    - way
  osm:
    - lanes=1
    - cycleway=lane

- feature: Pocket bike lane
  description: |
    Painted lane positioned between a right-turn lane and a through lane.
    Right turn lane length can be quite variable. The cycleway:middle tag is an invention, since there is no convention for this situation.
  elements:
    - way
  osm:
    - cycleway:middle=lane

- feature: Contraflow lane no separation
  description: |
    On one-way streets, only a yellow line separates two-way bike traffic. If there is physical separation in the form of a barrier or vertical discontinuity, see the enrty on contraflow lanes with physical separation.
  elements:
    - way
  osm:
    - cycleway=opposite_lane

- feature: Shoulder, not signed as a bike lane
  description: |
    A single line of paint delineates the shoulder.
    No signage or bike symbols present.
    Map if there is enough space to bike, i.e. at least 2-3ft wide
    Parking on the shoulder is typically permitted.
  elements:
    - way
  osm:
    - cycleway:left/right/both=shoulder # TO verifiy

- feature: Traffic-calming parking lane
  description: |
    Resembles a bike lane or paved shoulder,
    but is typically narrow and, unlike a paved shoulder,
    includes a curb. Intended to visually narrow the road and calm traffic speeds.

    Not specifically intended for cycling, but may be functional.
    Parking is typically permitted.
  elements:
    - way
  osm:
    -tag like any other shared road with/without parking

- feature: Pedestrian crossing
  description: |
    Controlled/uncontrolled pedestrian crossing often required to connect two non-intersecting ways
  elements:
    - way
  osm:
    - Draw as a separate way where zebra is
    - highway=footway
    - footway=crossing
