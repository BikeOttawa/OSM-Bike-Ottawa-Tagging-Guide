- Enable ["Parking Lanes" style in JOSM](https://blog.mapbox.com/mapping-turn-lanes-in-openstreetmap-5da9bf764f0d) to easily see existing parking tags
- Apply filter `highway=*` in JOSM (tick checkbox in Inverse column to hide everything but roads) - to avoid clutter and annoying landuse areas that stick to roads
- Use [Mapillary street imagery](https://www.mapillary.com/app/?focus=photo&pKey=av6oFzsyJPVLJgNV5VJCzg) for reference. Just open it in another tab and quickly jump back and forth. Takes a few seconds for each block. If you see parked cars right away - easy. If no cars around - check for sign posts and closest hydro poles. If still nothing - then parking is allowed.
- Don't bother with conditional parking. If parking is allowed at any point during the day then from stressmap point of view parking is allowed
- Cut ways if needed, when rules differ between blocks (In JOSM Ctrl-select road and node and press "P")
- If you have several roads with identical parking rules - just Ctrl-select them and add same tags
